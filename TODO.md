# TODO's

- [ ] coordinate transformation to orbital motion around sun
- [ ] check _s parameters. Barycenter same as orientation of binary wrt fixed frame
- [ ] check spin limits for parameter a
- [ ] What happens with the inclination for the Schwarzschild waveforms, because it is defined w.r.t. the angular momentum of the MBH.
- [ ] compute derivative w.r.t. sky localization in ssb again.
- [ ] use second detector from LISA
- [ ] function integration: has been reduced to positive integral because of negative frequency == complex conjugate. atm fs contains negative frequencies which is wrong
