# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

**Core value:** The simulation pipeline runs reliably on the GPU cluster as SLURM array jobs, producing enough Cramer-Rao bounds for statistically meaningful Hubble constant posteriors.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Code Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Code Hardening)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-26 — Roadmap created

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 are independent (both depend on Phase 1, both block Phase 4)
- [Roadmap]: TRACE requirements grouped into Phase 4 (SLURM infrastructure) since they require SLURM context

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 requires interactive cluster access to verify module names (GSL module name unconfirmed)
- Workspace expiration (60 days) is an operational risk — must be addressed in Phase 5 docs
